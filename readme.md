# Winter is coming, so as my exams

## A little intro 

Hi everyone, I am **KAM Wing Hang**, my SID is clear. 

## Some words to say

- I like philosophy rather than cs
- I am so sad that my quiz question did not be chosen, it was a very good question in terms of all aspect.
- The question should be the most difficult one.
- By the way, I have just watched the latest season of Game of Thrones
- It sucks
- I don't want to be a developer, it's boring. 
- Is it a big deal that I used GitHub before or not?
- I don't know how to use markdown.

> If you force me to say what languages I knew, I would say 'nothing'. If you don't know what is **Thread** , then you should not claim that you know Java. However, there is a lot of dummies outside there. 

## My tasks

- [ ] Individual ariticle, i will set the title as "How to be a cyber criminal without being caught by police"
- [ ] Understand what Kant thought 
- [ ] Spy on you
